# Unit & Integration Testing Project

This project focuses on writing and executing Python tests to validate code behavior.

It involves testing functions independently to ensure they return correct results under various conditions, as well as verifying how different parts of a program interact together when combined.

The project covers mocking, test parametrization, and distinguishing between isolated unit logic and complete integration flows.
