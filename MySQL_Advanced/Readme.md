# MySQL Advanced: Indexes, Procedures, Views & Triggers

## 📚 Description

This project explores advanced SQL concepts using MySQL 8.0.  
It focuses on writing efficient, maintainable and scalable database logic with a deeper understanding of:

- Table creation with constraints
- Query optimization using indexes
- Stored procedures and functions
- Views as query abstractions
- Triggers for automatic data logic

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Create tables with proper constraints (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Add indexes to optimize database performance
- Implement and call stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- Create and use views to simplify data access
- Set up triggers to automate data updates or validations
